<div style="text-align: justify">This project represents a comprehensive exploration at the nexus of industrial statistics, environmental science, and economics, targeting a pragmatic challenge in flood management. Our focus is on determining the optimal embankment heights to mitigate flood risks effectively. The foundation of our study is a robust dataset derived from real-world flood events, water flow dynamics, and economic impact assessments. The goal is to ascertain the most appropriate embankment height that not only offers adequate flood defense but also maintains economic viability. We adopt a three methodological approach, each offering a distinct perspective to analyze the data and shape our conclusions:

***Historical Measurement-Based Approach***: Leveraging historical flood data, this approach aims to utilize past measurement records as a guide for future embankment design, providing a practical, experience-based perspective.

***Hydraulic Model-Based Approach***: Here, we employ hydraulic modeling techniques to simulate water flow patterns and predict flood probabilities, offering an engineering-centric viewpoint for optimal embankment height determination.

***Economic Model-Based Approach***: This facet of our study integrates economic modeling to assess the financial implications of various embankment heights, ensuring our flood protection strategies are economically sustainable.

Through the integration of these three distinct research methodologies, our project aims to arrive at a multi-faceted solution that encapsulates a broad range of considerations, thereby ensuring a robust and comprehensive approach to flood management.</div>

### Parallel Computing: Parallel Implementation of Conway's Game of Life


<div style="text-align: justify">This project delves into the fascinating world of parallel computing through the implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classical example that illustrates how simple rules can lead to complex, life-like patterns. Originally conceived by John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life is a cellular automaton played on a two-dimensional N x N grid. Each cell within this grid, representing an individual unit of life, can exist in one of two states: alive or dead. The evolution of these cells, governed by a set of local rules, simulates the processes of birth, reproduction, and death, showcasing emergent large-scale behaviors from simple interactions.


Unlike traditional games, Conway's Game of Life is an autonomous system that evolves without user input, with each cell's fate determined by its surrounding neighbors. The key feature of this project is the implementation of these evolutionary steps through parallel computing techniques. This approach involves simultaneous computation, where the state of each cell in the subsequent generation is determined independently, based on its current state and those of its eight neighbors.


Our primary objective is to effectively implement Conway's Game of Life using parallel programming paradigms. This endeavor not only serves as a technical exercise in parallel computation but also provides insights into the broader implications of local interactions in complex systems. By leveraging parallel processing, we aim to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the simulation, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of Conway's Game of Life.</div>

### Statistical Quality Control

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/Projet_CQ.pdf)


<div style="text-align: justify">This project represents a rigorous exploration into the realm of manufacturing, with a specialized focus on augmenting process efficiency through the implementation of statistical quality control techniques. The core aim is to apply sophisticated statistical methodologies and adequacy tests to streamline manufacturing processes, thereby reducing waste and increasing the yield of products that meet specified quality standards.

Our methodology is centered around the development and application of advanced control charts, namely the CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart) and EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average). These robust statistical instruments are pivotal in our ability to precisely identify process irregularities and effectively monitor false alarm rates.

The CUSUM chart is particularly tailored for pinpointing subtle, incremental deviations from the set process targets over time. In contrast, the EWMA chart excels in detecting more abrupt and significant shifts. This dual-chart strategy equips us with a comprehensive toolkit for scrutinizing process variability and ensuring consistent process control.

The outcomes of this project are expected to substantially refine manufacturing processes. By applying these advanced statistical control methods, we anticipate not only an optimization of the manufacturing workflow but also a significant contribution towards reducing operational waste. This project stands to deliver critical insights and methodologies, fostering more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable manufacturing operations.</div>

#### Mixing models, Model-Based Clustering, EM algorithm

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/MSLTP2.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">Objective of this project is first to explore the behavior of the EM in the context of a simple Gaussian mixture model at J components in dimension 1
  
$$
  M = \{ \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_j \phi(\cdot; \mu_j, \sigma_j^2) : (\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_J) \in \Pi_J, \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_J \in \mathbb{R}, \sigma_1^2, \ldots, \sigma_J^2 \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{*} \}
$$
  
  
$$
  \text{and } \Pi_J = \{(\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_J) \in [0, 1]^J : \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_j = 1\} \text{ and } \phi(\cdot; \mu, \sigma^2) \text{ the Gaussian density of expectancy } \mu \text{ and variance } \sigma^2
$$
  
It is then to initiate the model-based clustering in higher dimension with the Rmixmod package, which allows to fit mixing models.

#### Bayesian methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/MSLTP3.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">This project is an introduction to Bayesian methods in the context of Gaussian mixture models models, and in particular to the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We are interested in the following mixture model:

$$
  M = \{ \pi \phi(\cdot; \mu_1, 1) + (1 - \pi) \phi(\cdot; \mu_2, 1) : \mu_1 \in \mathbb{R}, \mu_2 \in \mathbb{R} \},
$$
  
with $\phi$ being the Gaussian density on $\mathbb{R}$ and $\pi \neq \frac{1}{2}$ known.
  
The prior distribution of $(\mu_1, \mu_2)$ is given by: $\mu_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\delta_1, \frac{1}{\lambda}), \mu_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\delta_2, \frac{1}{\lambda}), \delta_1, \delta_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lambda > 0$, with $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ independent.

### Asset Allocation and Portfolio Optimisation

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/Rapport_projet.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, we grapple with a classic challenge in finance: determining an investment strategy that yields optimal performance over a specified time horizon, given a set of traded assets. Our exploration takes us into the core aspects of discrete-time portfolio optimization, where the balance between risk and reward comes to the fore.

We examine three of the principal criteria in portfolio optimization to provide a comprehensive view of the problem at hand. Our methodology revolves around two potent solution strategies:

Dynamic Programming Method: A versatile approach that breaks down the larger problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems, thereby simplifying complex optimization tasks.
Martingale Method: A powerful probabilistic technique, valuable in the context of investment strategies and financial forecasting.
Further enhancing our exploration, we dive into the practicalities by providing explicit examples for both the logarithmic utility function, which captures the investor's level of risk tolerance, and the full binomial case, a method used to model the dynamics of an asset's price over time.

By undertaking this project, we aim to offer profound insights into the world of finance, contributing to more efficient, optimized investment strategies and improved financial outcomes.</div>
