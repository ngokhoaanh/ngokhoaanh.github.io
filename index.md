### Machine Learning: Diabetes classification

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f32gj5IYIyFipoINiC8P3DvKat-WWLUK)

<div style="text-align: justify">To introduce the project, let's start with a small presentation of the framework, the data we have and the variables that compose our database. Then we will do a small visualization of the data and a study of their correlation in order to better understand the links between the variables. Then we will try a clustering (unsupervised learning) of K-means type to see if we can identify groups in our data. And finally, we will start on the training part of the different classifiers (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, SVM, QDA, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network) before concluding on the choice that we will make here for our problem.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Predicting Wikipedia page traffic is a useful task for understanding how users interact with the platform and for optimizing the performance and availability of Wikipedia servers. In this project, we aim to predict Wikipedia page traffic using three different machine learning models: ARIMA, XGBoost, and Random Forest.</div>

### Industrial statistics

<div style="text-align: justify">We have a real-life case study in the industry statistics research on floods, water flow, and economic models to determine the appropriate height of the embankment for minimizing potential risks. To solve this problem, we have three research directions: "Determining the height of the embankment based on historical measurement records, determining the height of the embankment based on the hydraulic model, and determining the height of the embankment based on the economic model."</div>

### Parallel Computing: Parallel Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">John Conway came up with the Game of Life in 1970. The game demonstrates the fact that some simple local rules can lead to interesting large-scale life behavior(birth, reproduction and death). The game is played in a 2 dimensional grid N x N, made of cells, that can be either alive, or dead. The game does not have any players, thus it does not require any input by the user. Each cell has at most 8 neighbours, that determine its state in the next generation. The re-formation of the grid from generation to generation is done simultaneously, meaning that each state in the next generation depends exclusively in the state of the cell and its neighbours. Our goal is to implement this game, using Parallel programming.</div>

### Statistical Quality Control

<div style="text-align: justify">Using statistical methods, adequacy tests, and constructing control charts such as CUSUM and EWMA to detect the moment of rupture and the false alarm rate. The results help processes, such as manufacturing, ensure that the procedures will produce more specification-conforming products, thereby creating less waste.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Collaborating with various tables (such as data.frames, tibbles, data.tables, etc.) utilizing dplyr or other query languages (as exemplified by data.table). Visualizing demographic data supplied by the Human Mortality Database organization (https://www.mortality.org). Employing PCA and other matrix-oriented techniques to investigate multivariate datasets (with lifetables considered as multivariate datasets). Applying the Lee-Carter model for predicting mortality quotients.</div>
